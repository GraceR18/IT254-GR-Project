# IT254-GR-Project

Our project is a timer controlled fan that uses voice recognition to set the timer for 10 seconds, 30 seconds, and 1 minute. We are going to use a button and led circuit to simulate a person walking in the room which we'll eventually change to a motion sensor and added temperature function.

Items: Arduino kit, Google Text to Speech API

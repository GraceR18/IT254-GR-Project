# IT254-GR-Project

Our project is a timer controlled fan that uses voice recognition to set the timer for run time. The button represents someone walking in a room and tunring on a light, signaling the program to run. When the fan is not actively running, it checks the temperature in the room. If the temperatrue passes the threshold, it turns the fan on until the temperature has dropped again.
